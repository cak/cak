# 👋 Hi, I'm Caleb

(aka **cak** on GitHub / **derail** at DEF CON)

**Securing software through code, data, and community.**

I help teams build and maintain secure software by blending strategy, architecture, and automation. My focus is turning complex security data into clear metrics and defensible decisions.

I work at [Posit](https://posit.co/) (formerly RStudio), shaping security strategy that protects our employees and the open-source and commercial tools trusted by millions of data scientists.

Outside of work, I maintain the web version of [HackerTracker](https://hackertracker.app/), volunteer as a DEF CON Goon, advise the [NumFOCUS Security Committee](https://numfocus.org/programs/security-committee), and build open-source tools that make life easier for developers and security practitioners alike.

## 🧩 TypeError

**[TypeError](https://github.com/TypeError)** is my home for open-source projects that make defense measurable, data-driven, and practical.  
It’s where software security, vulnerability management, and data science intersect to help defenders turn raw data into meaningful action.

## 🐉 Snally.com

**[Snally](https://github.com/snally-dev)** is a creative playground for development and data experiments.  
It’s where the analytical meets the weird, exploring ideas that don’t quite fit anywhere else.
