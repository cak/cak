# 👋 Hi, I'm Caleb

(aka **cak** on GitHub / **derail** at DEF CON)

**Securing software through code, data, and community.**

I help teams ship secure software by aligning strategy, architecture, and automation through clear metrics and sound decisions.

At [Posit](https://posit.co/), I shape security strategy for products trusted by millions of data scientists.

I also maintain the web version of [HackerTracker](https://hackertracker.app/), volunteer as a DEF CON Goon, advise the [NumFOCUS Security Committee](https://numfocus.org/programs/security-committee), and build open-source tools for developers and defenders.

**All opinions are my own.**

## TypeError

**[TypeError](https://github.com/TypeError)** is where I build open-source tools that make defense measurable and practical. It is where security, vulnerability data, and automation come together to help defenders take action.

## Snally.com

**[Snally](https://github.com/snally-dev)** is my creative playground for development and data experiments. It is where analytical meets weird and ideas find a home.
