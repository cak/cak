# 👋 Hi, I'm Caleb!

**Securing software through code, data, and community.**

I work across teams to improve security at every level, from strategy and architecture to secure development and automation, helping make secure software easier to build and maintain.

Outside of work, I volunteer as a DEF CON Goon, serve on the NumFOCUS Security Committee, and contribute to open source projects that make life easier for developers and security folks alike.

## 🚀 Current Projects

- **Dad Duties 👶👧** – Proud father, embracing the delightful chaos.  
- **[junctor/hackertracker-info](https://github.com/junctor/hackertracker-info)** – Helping maintain the official DEF CON 33 schedule at [info.defcon.org](https://info.defcon.org).

## 🌐 TypeError

[TypeError](https://github.com/TypeError) is my sandbox for tools at the intersection of software security and data science.

## 👾 Snally.com (coming soon)

A creative playground for data science experiments. Weird, fun, and data-rich.
