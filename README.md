# 👋 Hi, I'm Caleb

(aka **cak** on GitHub / **derail** at DEF CON)

**Securing software through code, data, and community.**

I help teams ship secure software by aligning strategy, architecture, and automation with clear metrics and sound decisions.

At [Posit](https://posit.co/), I shape security strategy for products used by millions of data scientists worldwide.

I also maintain the web version of [HackerTracker](https://hackertracker.app/), volunteer as a DEF CON Goon, advise the [NumFOCUS Security Committee](https://numfocus.org/programs/security-committee), and build open-source tools for developers and defenders.

_All opinions are my own._

## What I focus on

- Security strategy with measurable outcomes
- Secure software architecture and enablement
- Automation that turns data into action
- Community, mentoring, and open-source stewardship

## Currently building

- **[secure](https://github.com/TypeError/secure)** — A modern Python library for HTTP security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.) with secure defaults and presets for Shiny, FastAPI, Django, Flask, and other ASGI/WSGI apps.
- **[osv-supply-chain-insights](https://github.com/TypeError/osv-supply-chain-insights)** — Data-driven analysis of open-source supply-chain vulnerability trends using OSV.
- **[elf](https://github.com/cak/elf)** — A modern Advent of Code helper that fetches inputs, submits answers, and tracks your progress.

## Projects

**[TypeError](https://github.com/TypeError)**  
Open-source tools that make defense measurable and practical—bringing vulnerability data, security engineering, and automation together to help teams take action.

**[Snally](https://github.com/snally-dev)**  
A creative playground for development and data experiments, and a home for ideas that do not fit anywhere else.
