## ðŸ‘‹ I'm Caleb.

I'm a seasoned professional with expertise in vulnerability management, application security, and full stack development. I enjoy combining data science with security research to uncover insights and improve security practices.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, exploring new coffee spots, and participating in DEF CON events.
